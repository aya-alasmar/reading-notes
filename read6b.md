#### How Computers Work!
#####  how the computer  work ?
###### 1 take input from microphone , keyboard ,mouse ,camera ,.. etc .  All these different inputs give a computer information.
###### 2 the computers stored the information in memory 
###### 3 A computer's processor takes information from memory (manipulates it or changes it using an algorithm)
###### 4 output (the results shown as text, photos, videos, ,..,etc)
##### these four stages are common to all computers.
###### * Computers started out as basic calculators.

##### Binary & Data:
###### * ones and zeroes do play a big role in how computers work on the inside.
###### * Inside a computer are electric wires and circuits that carry all the information in a computer.
###### * if you have a single wire with electricity flowing through ,the signal could either be (on,off)(True,False)(yes,no) this state of a single wire is called a bit.
###### * In binary,we multiply by 2 , we have a position 1 ,2 , 3 ,..
###### * The more wires you use, the larger the numbers you can store.
###### * With 8 wires, you can store numbers between 0 and 255.
###### * text, images, or sound all these things can also be represented with numbers

##### Circuits and Logic :
* Every input or output of a computer is effectively a type of information ,which can be represented by on or off electrical signals , It takes an electrical signal, on or off, and it flips it ,if the signal you give it is a 1, the circuit gives you a 0 ,and if you give the circuit a 0, it gives you a 1 , The signal that goes in is not the same as the signal that comes out, and so we call this circuit not.

* Each number is represented using 8 bits, resulting in 16 different electrical signals that go into the circuit.

* The circuit for an 8-bit adder has lots of little adders inside of it, which together, calculate the sum.

* smaller computers fater because the smaller the circuit is, the less distance the electrical signal has to go.

##### CPU, Memory, Input & Output:
When you press a key on your keyboard - let's say the letter "B". The keyboard converts the letter to a number,That number is sent as binary, ones and zeros, into the computer, Starting from this number, the CPU calculates how to display the letter "B" pixel by pixel ,The CPU requests step-by-step instructions from memory, which tell it how to draw the letter "B".
**This all happens so quickly it feels instantaneous**


##### Hardware and Software :
* The CPU is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer. It has circuits to do simple math and logic.
* The CPU receives simple commands that tell it which circuit to use to do a specific job.For example, an "add" command tells the CPU to use its outer circuit to calculate a new number.And then the "store" command tells the CPU to use a different circuit to save that result into memory.
* Binary code is the most basic form of software and it controls all the hardware of a computer.
* The operating system of the computer is the master program that manages how software gets to use the hardware of the computer.
* Inside every computer is an operating system managing software that controls the computer's hardware.
