#### How Computers Work!
#####  how the computer  work ?
###### 1 take input from microphone , keyboard ,mouse ,camera ,.. etc .  All these different inputs give a computer information.
###### 2 the computers stored the information in memory 
###### 3 A computer's processor takes information from memory (manipulates it or changes it using an algorithm)
###### 4 output (the results shown as text, photos, videos, ,..,etc)
##### these four stages are common to all computers.
###### * Computers started out as basic calculators.

##### Binary & Data:
###### * ones and zeroes do play a big role in how computers work on the inside.
###### * Inside a computer are electric wires and circuits that carry all the information in a computer.
###### * if you have a single wire with electricity flowing through ,the signal could either be (on,off)(True,False)(yes,no) this state of a single wire is called a bit.
###### * In binary,we multiply by 2 , we have a position 1 ,2 , 3 ,..
###### * The more wires you use, the larger the numbers you can store.
###### * With 8 wires, you can store numbers between 0 and 255.
###### * text, images, or sound all these things can also be represented with numbers
