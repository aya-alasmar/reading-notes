#### HTML:
    the create the structure of the pages and determine the content you want .
#### Css:
    to add style of pages and content that written using HTML ,also you can use the same style of theme to the all pages.
#### JavaScript:
    to add a functionality to the website , you can write the code  and also reuse the code on several l pages (making the site faster to load and easier to maintain) , JAVASCRIPT RUNS WHERE IT IS FOUND IN THE HTML

##### How to use object and method :
`Document.write(‘Good afternoon’); `
1	**The document object** represents the entire web page , the document has a multiple methods and props that called [ members of that object]
2	**Dot** : members operator allow us to access to the members of that object by enter the name of the member you want to access it .
3	**Write `(‘ ‘)`** : `document(object) has a write (method/ member) that’s allow you to write anything inside ‘ ‘ ( that called a parameters) and then will be displayed in web page.`

* JavaScript file is a same with HTML file or CSS file but with .js extension, when you need to use the js file you should add `<script src=”jsName.js”> </script>.`
* A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.

**JAVASCRIPT IS CASE SENSITIVE this mean aya not equal AYA or Aya**

* `Add comment to explain to you do in this code, use // before the text to write a single line comment, /* with multiple lines and end with */` 

* `Choose a meaningful names for variables, names that indicate to the value inside it.`

* `Var keyword using to indicate that we want to create variable .`
 **`Va x ;`**

To assign then the value 
X = value 
`The values could be number (0,1,2,…,etc or fraction numbers )or string (group of characters starts and ends with “ “ or ‘ ‘ ) or Boolean(True,false)`

`To print the “ inside the code used backslash before the” to escape the quotation mark .`

`When you assigned a value to variable you can change the value by write the variable name and then assigned the new value .`
`Var x=5 ;`
`X= 8 `
`This called “ overwriting” and the final value that stored in x is 8 /`


6 Rules to choose the variable name :
1 `The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.`
2 `The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.`
3 `You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. For example, var is a keyword used to declare a variable. Reserved words are ones that may be used in a future version of JavaScript. ONLINE EXTRA View a full list of keywords and reserved words in JavaScript.`
4 `All variables are case sensitive so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.`
5 `Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. For example, fi rstName might be used to store a person's first name, l astNarne for their last name, and age for their age.`
6 `If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. For example, f i rstName rather than fi rstnarne (this is referred to as camel case). You can also use an underscore between each word (you cannot use a dash).`
